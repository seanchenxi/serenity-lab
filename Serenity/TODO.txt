1. Treat the logged in user post comments case. Logged in user can be found in cookies.
2. Treat comment error case: 
   - Duplicate comment (click submit twice), server returned an error html page.
3. Maybe show differently for logged in user.
4. Prepare Google Ajax Crawl
5. View should never know what it is showing. The presenter will tell view how to show and show what
   (ArticleView, DiscussionListView, RespondView !!!, it's presenter who treat reply, cancel, etc... action)
